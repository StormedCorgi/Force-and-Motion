      Isaac Newton: a background
    </h2>
    <P>
      // Isaac Newton was a 17th Century scientist. He popularized the three laws of motion. He grew up without a mother or father figure, but had a good deal of education. He grew up and lived during the scientific revolution, a period of great scientific achievment and lots of new discoveries. Throughout the period of his life, he had many rivals. Out of those, the most infamous are Robert Hooke and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. His rivalry wis Leibniz was over a plagiarism claim, because Leibniz and Newton both came to the concept of calculus through their own studies. Leibniz was the first of the two to publish their calculus theories, although Newton came up with them before Liebniz did. This caused a great rivalry that would haunt both of them to the grave and beyond, in the case of Leibniz. Even after Leibniz had passed away, Newton continued to be angered by the claims and hated him until the day he died. Newton was also known for his discoveries in light science. //

      Newton's Three Laws of Motion
    </h2>
    <p>
      // Newton popularized three laws of motion in his lifetime, which are vital to today's understanding of physics and motion. The first law of motion states that a motion at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. An object in motion will remain in motion unless acted on by an unbalanced force.
