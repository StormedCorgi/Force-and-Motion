      Isaac Newton: a background
    </h2>
    <P>
      // Isaac Newton was a 17th Century scientist. He popularized the three laws of motion. He grew up without a mother or father figure, but had a good deal of education. He grew up and lived during the scientific revolution, a period of great scientific achievment and lots of new discoveries. Throughout the period of his life, he had many rivals. Out of those, the most infamous are Robert Hooke and Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz. His rivalry wis Leibniz was over a plagiarism claim, because Leibniz and Newton both came to the concept of calculus through their own studies. Leibniz was the first of the two to publish their calculus theories, although Newton came up with them before Liebniz did. This caused a great rivalry that would haunt both of them to the grave and beyond, in the case of Leibniz. Even after Leibniz had passed away, Newton continued to be angered by the claims and hated him until the day he died. Newton was also known for his discoveries in light science. //

      Newton's Three Laws of Motion
    </h2>
    <p>
      // Newton popularized three laws of motion in his lifetime, which are vital to today's understanding of physics and motion. The first law of motion states that a motion at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. An object in motion will remain in motion unless acted on by an unbalanced force. His second law of motion states that the acceleratoin of the body is directly proportional to the net force acting on the body and inversly proportional to the mass of the body. His third law of motion states that for every action there is an equal and opposite reaction. These three laws of motion define and outline all of modern-day physics, hence the importance of including them in this website. //

      Gravity and Friction: Forces are Everywhere!
    </h2>
    <p>
      // Gravity and friction are two examples of forces that you see all the time! Gravity is the force that keeps you, and everything else, stuck to the ground. All objects in our universe have some amount of gravity. Gravity is also the force that keeps the moon in the Earth's orbit. Friction is the force that generally slows things down. It does this by causing objects that are touching to slightly stick together, making them want to stay stuck. This causes them to slow down. An example of friction would be a ball rolling across the ground and slowing down to a stop. //

    <h2>
      Net Force
    </h2>
    <p>
      // Net force is the total amount of force being exerted on an object. It is calculated based on the direction of the forces and how strong they are, measured in Newtons. If the two forces are pushing or pulling in the same direction, then the forces are added together to calculate the net force. If the two forces are pushing or pulling against each other, then the resultant force is the difference between the two. If the two forces are pushing in different but not opposite directions then you calculate the direction and amount of the resultant force by setting up a triangle. To set up this triangle you take the different directions of the force to create the sides and then the last side is created by the resultant force. //

    <h2>
      Inertia and Balanced Forces
    </h2>
    <p>
      // Inertia is explained by Newton's first law of motion. It states that an object in motion will remain in motion unless acted on by an unbalanced force and an object at rest will remain at rest unless acted on by an unbalanced force. Inertia is this exactly. Inertia is basically saying that if an object starts moving through space without being acted on by any unbalanced forces it will continue to move indefinitely. It is also saying that if an object is at rest, then that object will not move until it is acted on by an unbalanced force. On the topic of unbalanced forces, an unbalanced force is a force with a net force greater than 0. A balanced force is a force with a net force equal to 0. //
